<b>1.  Distributed memory (MPI) runs in 2D</b>  (first posted: 14 August 2006)
<p>
CM1 does not work properly for MPI runs in 2D.  MPI should be avoided for 2D simulations until further notice.  (There are no problems with single-processor runs or OpenMP (shared memory) runs.  There are no problems with 3D runs in MPI.)
<p>
Updated, 12 August 2008:  This problem also applies to axisymmetric simulations.  Do not run axisymmetric simulations with MPI.
